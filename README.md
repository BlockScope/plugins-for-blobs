Units of measure as a GHC typechecker plugin
--------------------------------------------

The `uom-plugin` library adds support for units of measure to GHC using the new experimental facility for typechecker plugins, which is available in recent builds of GHC HEAD and will be included in GHC 7.10.  See `uom-plugin-example` for an example of a package that uses the library.
